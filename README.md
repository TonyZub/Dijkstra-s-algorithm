# Dijkstra's algorithm (Interactive graph)
- Vertex and edges data is stored in ScriptableObject file - Resources/Data/GraphData;
- When entering playmode, vertexes and edges are created on scene. And after exiting playmode the changes are saved (can turn that off in Resources/Data/ProgrammhData);
- You can edit graph with mouse on scene (you can click on vertexes or edges to manipulate them);
- It is also possible to edit data in inspector (in playmode) in MainControllers object;
- To find the shortest path from one vertex to another - you need to click on some vertex then click on the button "Find path" and then click on another vertex;
